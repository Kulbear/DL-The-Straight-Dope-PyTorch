# DL-The-Straight-Dope-PyTorch

This repo contains notebooks that reproduce tutorials and experiments from [Deep Learning - The Straight Dope](https://gluon.mxnet.io/index.html).

## Introduction

The original tutorial is based on MXNet's `gluon` APIs. I think there is no similar work for the PyTorch community so I rewrite the code in PyTorch, with minimal modifications (for example, I probably switch to another dataset). I directly copied the text contents from the existing work with some sort of selection.

I modified the text content slightly but keep all the core contents remained. In addition, I only rewrite those notebooks based on `gluon`, if you want to have a look at the `from scratch` series. Currently, I have no plan to do in the near future.

The original work is licensed under the Apache License 2.0, here I still stick with it.
